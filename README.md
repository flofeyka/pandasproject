Sorting and editing Excel databases in python programming language

The first school project that was written entirely by me. 
In the classroom, within the framework of ITLab, in the course "Programming in Python", we were given the task: to write a project with any content in the Python programming language. Any program with any content and any functions can become a project. 
We have chosen a topic that concerns the use of the capabilities of the Python programming language in working with the database, sorting and editing it.
DB is an actual topic, it will always be relevant. Nowadays there is no such program that would not use a database to work with its user.

During the writing of the program, first one file was used for the entire compilation, and then the entire program code was divided into many functions and into several files. The sortable and editable data was checked repeatedly, as well as their display. Initially, errors were identified when writing the program code.
